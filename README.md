# react-sass-airbnb

React-SASS-AirBnB is a project that provides you a boilerplate tool for React following the [Airbnb's Javascript (ES6) Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), and including some features that allows you to use SASS as your style tool in the app.

# Features
* Simple `/dist/index.html` loading `bundle.js`.
* Starter `/src/index.js` for React.
* Starter `/src/_global.scss` for style your app.
* All code following Airbnb's Javascript (ES6) style guide.
* Webpack dev server with automatic reloading. Just need to run `$ npm start`.
* Deployment build with `$ npm run build -p`

# Components
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)

# Getting start
Just run the following commands in your terminal to start coding
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yoniihdc/react-sass-airbnb
$ cd react-sass-airbnb
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The last command automatically opens your browser and you can see your first react app running. In case you don't, you can manually go to http://localhost:3000.

# Deployment

To create a build for production you need to build your current project with the following command:

`$ npm run build -p`

Then just copy all files inside `/dist` folder and put all of them in your server.
